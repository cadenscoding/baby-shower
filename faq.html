        <h4>A note on gifting:</h4>
  
        <p>Please do not feel obligated to purchase a gift! We want you to celebrate with us, not bring us things! Your presence is more than enough. </p>
  
        <p>If you feel inclined to bring something we ask that you please stick to our registry as we spent lots of time mindfully curating it to suit our lifestyle and needs (hello small living space!) and we have been fortunate to receive <b>many</b> hand-me-down items for baby. </p>
  
        <p>Alternatively, if you are comfortable, consider a monetary contribution or gift cards (amazon, home depot/lowes, grocery stores).</p>
  
        <p>If you still want to go rogue we ask that you do not purchase anything plastic or polyester!
          In our home we greatly prioritize natural materials. Thank you for understanding!</p>
  
        <h4>When is baby due?</h4>
  
        <p>We hope you will respect our wishes in wanting to keep the estimated due date private. Like they say, babies come on their own time! We are preparing for our new arrival sometime in February. </p>
  
        <h4>What is the gender?</h4>
  
        <p>It’s a surprise!</p>
